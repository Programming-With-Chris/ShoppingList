# ShoppingList


## Major Features needed for MVP
- Sorting by aisle (Data from API, sorting by ??? (that might be where the ML comes in))
- Create new list starting with last week's list

## The Build Roadmap
- ✔ Base app build to give me a UI to test in 
- ✔ Database and data persistence features (In our case, Sqlite)
- ✔ Add APIs to grab information we need - At the moment, this is just hooked up to the Kroger API, more stores added in the future
- Sorting Algorithms - Building an efficient path through the store
- Basic List Creation features - A good 'starting point' for a user, maybe different list types we can keep up with (weekly groceries vs stuff for a party, etc)
- UI work to make the app actually look good
- Personal testing in a Grocery store 
- Maybe a soft launch at this point?
- Feature Roadmap starts

## Feature Roadmap
- Supporting more stores
- Skia graphic showing a route through the store?
- As I think of more features, we'll put them here.
